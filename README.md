# TravelPlanner

TravelPlanner is a React web application designed to help users plan and organize their trips. Users can explore destinations, filter them based on meal preferences, view travel details, and create customized itineraries.

## Features

- **Destination Search**: Search for travel destinations with detailed information.
- **Custom Itinerary Creation**: Create personalized itineraries by adding destinations, activities, and accommodations.
- **Meal Preferences Filter**: Filter destinations based on specific meal preferences like vegetarian, vegan, or gluten-free.
- **Real-time Updates**: Get up-to-date information on destinations, including weather and best travel times.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload if you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
For more information on running tests, check the [Create React App test documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!\
For more details, check the [deployment guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you want more control over the build tool and configuration, you can eject. This will remove the single build dependency and copy all configuration files into the project, giving you full control over them. After ejecting, you will need to manage configurations like webpack and Babel yourself.

You don't have to eject unless you're ready to customize the build setup.

## Installation

To get started with the TravelPlanner app on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khanyajara/TravelPlanner.git


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
